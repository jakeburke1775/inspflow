this is a tool to schedule inspections faster for my current job.

In order to schedule an inspection for a job, the poorly designed orlando inspection portal prompts you to punch in the permit number everytime an inspection is scheduled. I simply need a sheet of all my lot numbers and their coresponding permit numbers. I want to be able to click on a link that first copies the permit number to the clipboard then take me to the portal. Thats it! 

It is an extremely simple mechanism but I do this several times a week, so if you factor in slow loading times, distraction from being able to jump on more important tasks, its a life saver. This is most beneficial to townhomes, where I need to schedule several units at one time.


## future ideas
add a weather dash and a warning messege if the next day is a government holiday.
